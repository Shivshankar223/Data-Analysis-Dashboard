## Project Objective  
- To analyze sales executives’ performance across multiple regions.  
- To track total sales, target hit percentage, and deviation from targets.  
- To provide an interactive dashboard for decision-making.  
- To visualize KPIs using charts (bar chart, pie chart, line chart).
